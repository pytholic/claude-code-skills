name: codebase-research
description: Navigate, search, and map codebases efficiently to answer structural and locational questions. Use this skill whenever the user asks where something is in a codebase, how the code is organized, where a pattern or symbol is used or defined, what depends on a module, or whether something is still in use. Trigger for any of these signals: "where is this logic?", "find all usages of X", "where is Y defined?", "how is the codebase structured?", "what imports Z?", "is this used anywhere?", "which files handle X?", "give me an overview of the codebase", or any architectural question about an existing project. Always prefer this skill over ad-hoc file reading — it produces ranked, synthesized answers rather than raw tool output.

# Codebase Research

Structured methodology for navigating and understanding codebases of any language or size.

---

## Core Principle

**SEARCH BEFORE READING. NEVER OPEN FILES WITHOUT KNOWING THEY MATTER.**

Opening files speculatively wastes context and produces noisy answers. Always locate candidates first with search tools, then read only the files confirmed to be relevant.

**Tooling Preference (in order):**
1. `rg` (ripgrep) — fastest, natively respects `.gitignore`
2. `git grep` / `git ls-files` — respects `.gitignore`, available in any git repo
3. `grep -rn` + explicit `--exclude-dir` — fallback only when neither above is available

Never write out long `--exclude-dir` lists when `rg` or `git grep` can replace them.

---

## Triage Gate

Before starting, classify the effort required:

- **Simple lookup** (one symbol, one file, answer obvious from a single search): Run the search, return the annotated result directly.
- **Structural question** (architecture overview, dependency chain, cross-cutting pattern, module responsibility): Use the full phased approach below.

When in doubt, default to the full approach — it takes minutes and prevents incomplete or misleading answers.

---

## Language-Specific Patterns

Identify the project's language/ecosystem and load the relevant reference:

| Language / Stack        | Reference File                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Python                  | [references/python.md](references/python.md) |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | [references/js-ts.md](references/js-ts.md)   |

**If the language is not listed** (Go, Rust, Java, C#, etc.), do not stop — infer the standard constructs for that language (e.g., `interface` vs `trait`, `struct` vs `class`, `package` vs `namespace`, `#include` vs `import`) and adapt the generic Phase 2 patterns accordingly.

---

## Phase 1: Orient

Always start here — even for simple lookups, a 30-second orientation prevents searching in the wrong place.

```bash
# 1. Top-level structure and file distribution (git-aware, no noise)
git ls-files | awk -F/ '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Fallback if not a git repo:
# find . -maxdepth 2 -type d | grep -vE 'node_modules|\.git|\.venv|dist|build|__pycache__' | sort

# 2. Entrypoints, config, and dependency manifests
git ls-files | grep -iE '^main\.|^app\.|^index\.|^cli\.|Makefile|package\.json|pyproject\.toml|Cargo\.toml|go\.mod|pom\.xml|build\.gradle'
```

Use this map to anchor all subsequent findings before searching.

---

## Phase 2: Classify and Search

Identify the query type below, then apply the matching strategy.
All commands prefer `git grep` / `git ls-files`. Substitute `rg PATTERN` or `grep -rn PATTERN` if not in a git repo.

---

### 2A — File Name Discovery
*"Where are the controllers?" / "Find the user service" / "Which files handle auth?"*

Finding files by name is often faster than searching contents — always try this first for structural questions.

```bash
# Find files matching a name pattern
git ls-files | grep -i 'PATTERN'

# Examples:
git ls-files | grep -iE 'service|controller|route|handler|middleware|repo|repository'
git ls-files | grep -iE 'test|spec'        # All test files
git ls-files | grep -iE '\.config\.'       # Config files
```

---

### 2B — Usage Search
*"Where do we use X?" / "Show all usages of Y" / "Which files call Z?"*

```bash
# Count first — know the scope before enumerating
git grep -l 'PATTERN' | wc -l

# Primary search with line numbers
git grep -n 'PATTERN'

# Narrow to production code (exclude tests/specs)
git grep -n 'PATTERN' | grep -vE '/test|/spec|/mock|_test\.|\.spec\.|\.test\.'
```

**Result ranking** — present findings in this order:
1. Core business/domain logic
2. Configuration and wiring
3. Tests (label them as such — useful for understanding intended behavior)

---

### 2C — Definition Search
*"Where is X defined?" / "Where is class Y?" / "Where is function Z?"*

```bash
# Adapt keywords to the detected language
git grep -n -E '(class|def|function|const|type|interface|struct|trait|fn)\s+SYMBOL\b'

# For exported/public symbols specifically
git grep -n -E 'export.*(class|function|const|type)\s+SYMBOL\b'        # JS/TS
git grep -n -E '^pub (fn|struct|trait|impl)\s+SYMBOL\b'                # Rust
git grep -n -E '^(public|private|protected).*(class|void)\s+SYMBOL\b'  # Java/C#
```

If multiple definitions appear (e.g., abstract base + concrete implementation), surface all of them — this split is architecturally meaningful.

---

### 2D — Dependency Trace
*"What imports X?" / "What depends on Y?" / "What does Z import?"*

```bash
# Who imports this module or symbol? (reverse — who depends on it)
git grep -n -E '(import|from|require|use|#include).*MODULE_OR_SYMBOL'

# What does this file depend on? (forward — what it pulls in)
head -50 path/to/file | grep -E '^import|^from|^require|^use |^#include|^using '
```

**Aliasing — critical step:** Scan results for renamed imports:
- Python: `from module import Foo as Bar` → track `Bar`
- JS/TS: `import { Foo as Bar }` or `import * as Bar` → track `Bar`
- Go: `import alias "package/path"` → track `alias`

If an alias is found, immediately run a secondary Usage Search (2B) for the alias name. Missing aliases is the most common cause of incomplete dependency traces.

---

### 2E — Module Overview
*"What does this module do?" / "Explain the X/ folder"*

```bash
# 1. Files in the module
git ls-files -- 'module_path/*'

# 2. Read the public API declaration first (the entry point declares intent)
cat module_path/__init__.py  2>/dev/null  # Python
cat module_path/index.ts     2>/dev/null  # TypeScript
cat module_path/index.js     2>/dev/null  # JavaScript
cat module_path/mod.rs       2>/dev/null  # Rust
cat module_path/lib.go       2>/dev/null  # Go

# 3. Skim all top-level definitions in the module (no bodies)
git grep -n -E '^(class|def|function|export|pub fn|func|type|interface|struct)\s+' -- 'module_path/*'

# 4. Find the most central file (largest = most logic)
git ls-files -- 'module_path/*' | xargs wc -l 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -5
```

Summarize as: **Purpose → Public API → Key classes/functions → How it connects outward**.

---

### 2F — Architecture Map
*"How is the codebase structured?" / "Give me an overview" / "What are the main components?"*

```bash
# 1. All module entry points
git ls-files | grep -E '__init__\.py$|/index\.ts$|/index\.js$|/mod\.rs$'

# 2. Entrypoints (main execution)
git grep -l -E 'if __name__.*__main__|ReactDOM\.render|createRoot|app\.listen|fn main\(\)|func main\(\)'

# 3. Contract layer — abstract bases, interfaces, protocols, traits
git grep -n -E 'class.*\b(ABC|Protocol)\b|^interface |^abstract class |^trait |^type.*interface\b'

# 4. Wiring and dependency injection files
git ls-files | grep -iE 'dependencies|container|config|settings|providers|module|wiring'
```

Present findings as a conceptual layer diagram:
- **Entry layer** — CLI, HTTP handlers, event listeners, main executables
- **Domain / service layer** — business logic, use cases, application services
- **Infrastructure layer** — DB, external APIs, storage, queues, caches
- **Shared / cross-cutting** — config, utils, base classes, types, constants

---

### 2G — Dead Code Check
*"Is X still used?" / "Can I delete Y?"*

```bash
# Step 1: Confirm definition exists
git grep -n -E '(def|class|function|const|type)\s+SYMBOL\b'

# Step 2: All usages excluding the definition line
git grep -n '\bSYMBOL\b' | grep -vE '(def|class|function|const)\s+SYMBOL'

# Step 3: Check if re-exported in the module's public API
git grep -n 'SYMBOL' $(git ls-files | grep -E '__init__\.py$|index\.(ts|js)$')

# Step 4: Test-only callers (a symbol only called from tests is de-facto unused in production)
git grep -n '\bSYMBOL\b' | grep -E '/test|/spec|_test\.|\.spec\.|\.test\.'
```

Return a clear verdict: **Used** / **Unused** / **Uncertain** — with explicit reasoning for each.

---

## Phase 3: Synthesize and Present

**Never output raw search results.** Always annotate and synthesize.

### Output Format

```
## Finding: [one-line direct answer to the question]

### Locations
- `path/to/file:42` — [what is happening here and why it matters]
- `path/to/other:87` — [what is happening here]

### Context
[1–3 sentences on what this tells us about the design or architecture]

### Notes  ← only include if genuinely useful
[Caveats, aliases spotted, related symbols, patterns worth knowing]
```

**Rules:**
- Lead with the answer, not the search process
- File paths must be relative and include line numbers (`path/to/file:42`)
- Every location gets an annotation — no bare paths or line numbers
- If more than ~8 results, group them: "5 usages in `api/routes/`, 2 in `services/`, 1 in tests"
- If nothing found, say so immediately and suggest likely alternatives (typo? aliased import? different module?)

---

## Process Violations — Red Flags

Stop and correct if you catch yourself doing any of the following:

- Opening files speculatively to search their contents instead of using `grep`/`rg` first
- Writing long `--exclude-dir` lists when `rg` or `git grep` would handle it automatically
- Pasting raw search output without annotation
- Reading every file in a directory instead of checking the public API entry first
- Running the same search twice with slightly different wording instead of narrowing with better flags
- Reporting 20+ locations without grouping or prioritizing
- Tracing a dependency without checking for aliased imports

---

## Pre-Answer Checklist

Before presenting findings, verify:

- [ ] Oriented first — directory structure mapped before any search
- [ ] Searched before reading — no files opened speculatively
- [ ] Best tool used — `rg` or `git grep` preferred over bare `grep`
- [ ] Aliases checked — import renaming scanned during any dependency trace
- [ ] All locations annotated — no raw search output presented
- [ ] Answer leads with the finding — search mechanics not narrated to the user
